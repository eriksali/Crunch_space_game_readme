## Delete launch.json, settings.json -> Run -> Add Configration -> add to launch.json: "vmArgs": "--module-path /Users/ericsali/Documents/javafx-sdk-19/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics,javafx.media,javafx.swing" -> add references (javafx .jar files) to the same path above.


## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
